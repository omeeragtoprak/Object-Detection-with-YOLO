## Installation

1. Clone the YOLOv5 repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
   cd yolov5
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -qr requirements.txt
   pip install -q roboflow
   ```

3. Verify the setup:

   ```python
   import torch
   print(f"Setup complete. Using torch {torch.__version__}")
   ```

---

## Dataset Preparation

1. Use [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) to manage your dataset:
   - Upload and annotate your images on Roboflow.
   - Export the dataset in YOLO format.

2. Download the dataset directly to your project using Roboflow's API integration.

   Example:

   ```python
   from roboflow import Roboflow

   rf = Roboflow(api_key="your_api_key")
   project = rf.workspace().project("your_project_name")
   dataset = project.version(1).download("yolov5")
   ```

---

## Training the Model

1. Modify the YOLOv5 configuration file to point to your dataset and adjust hyperparameters as needed.
2. Start training:

   ```bash
   python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 50 --data data.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt
   ```

3. Monitor training metrics and adjust parameters for optimal performance.

---

## Inference

1. Perform inference on test images:

   ```bash
   python detect.py --source data/images --weights runs/train/exp/weights/best.pt --img 640
   ```

2. View results in the output directory:

   ```bash
   ls runs/detect/exp
   ```

---

## Results

- The model achieves high accuracy on detecting objects in the dataset.
- Visualization of predictions is saved in the output directory for review.
